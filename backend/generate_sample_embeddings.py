                FastTrack Community Partners,Statement of Work, ,, Date ,,This document describes the FastTrack Community Partner deliverables/services for Microsoft 365. Note that this does not include the purchase or activation of the Microsoft 365 license. The customer must have 150 or more licenses to qualify. The Microsoft 365 Service is not customizable and cannot be modified beyond what is outlined in the M icrosoft 365 Service Descriptions.,,"Prior to signing a service contract that references this Statement of Work (SOW), the customer must review the latest Microsoft 365 Service Description and acknowledge that the Service Description meets or exceeds their minimum requirements for the selected services.",,"On the following pages, please review the topics of the Statement of Work and upon completion provide a copy of the SOW to the customer.",,, ,,Contact ,,,"[Your Address] ","[City, ST ZIP Code]" ,,,"[Your Phone]" ,,,"[Your Email]" ,,,Your Website FastTrack Benefit and/or Value-Added Services. FastTrack Benefit services are to be delivered remotely, using the Advanced Deployment Guides with the customer. Partners may provide verbal and written assistance. FRPs are encouraged to use the FastTrack Playbook and other Microsoft FastTrack resources to deliver the FastTrack Benefit to ensure a smooth and successful delivery. Value-Added services are agreed upon fee-based services that address customer needs outside the scope of the FastTrack Benefit. Important! Have you explained the FastTrack Benefit to your customer? Roles and Responsibilities. Partner roles and responsibilities for delivering the benefit. During FastTrack Benefit Services delivery, Partners will:
Assist the customer with the enablement of all claimed or assigned workloads. Deliver the FastTrack Benefit Services for claimed or assigned workloads. For more detailed information, review the FastTrack Partner Community Terms and Conditions. Customer role and responsibilities. Customer has dedicated resources to run the Advanced Deployment Guides. In instances where the partner provides value-added services (including enablement on site) the customer should provide the following: Provide suitable workspace, if required. Provide LAN connections that give the Partner onsite team access to the Internet and email. Provide access to necessary customer work sites, systems logins and passwords, and material and resources as needed and as advised by Microsoft in advance. Assume responsibility for the management of all vendors who are not managed by the Partner. Provide access, with proper licenses, to the tools and third-party products that the Partner team needs to complete its assigned tasks. Facilitate the change management process, when necessary, to enable required changes to the customer environment. Acquire and install the appropriate server capacity that is required to support the environments as defined in the scope section of this SOW at least two weeks prior to the start of work on the scope as defined in the project plan. Throughout the project, the partner will submit requests for decisions or feedback for the customer to complete. Decisions are assigned due dates, and it is assumed that the customer will provide the required feedback or make decisions on either the due date agreed upon or within three business days of submittal. If a decision or feedback is not provided by the due date or within three business days, it will be addressed as a potential change of scope pursuant to the change management process outlined in this SOW. Important! Have you explained the Partner and Customer roles and responsibilities to your customer? Timeline. The timeline is based on customer intent and theenablement plan. There are three phases for a successful deployment and adoption.
![Image 1] Have you discussed with the customer a strategy and timeline to drive a realistic and successful migration? Key Project Service Deliverables. During the Deployment Plan Project Phase, the partner team collaborates with the Microsoft Account team to acquire an overview of the customers M365 strategy to provide a unified roadmap to enable the envisioned services. During the Core Onboarding Project, the initial Tenant Identity and Authentication are set up. During the Service Onboarding Project, service and/or workloads are enabled. Important! Have you discussed the key project service deliverables with the customer? Areas Out of Scope of the FastTrack Benefit. The partner and customer must negotiate the for fee services that the partner will provide. The areas that are out of scope for this engagement may include, but are not limited to, the following: Modifications to the Microsoft 365 Service beyond the configurable options Managing end-user and organizational communications, documentation, training, and change management processes Help-desk documentation and training Formal user training (such as workshops, classroom, and books) or development of custom training courses or materials, except as explicitly defined as in-scope Producing customer-specific reports, presentations, or meeting minutes Prework required at the customer site Architectural and technical documentation specific to the customer, except as explicitly defined as in-scope Design, procurement, installation, and configuration of hardware and networking Procurement, installation, and configuration of software, except as explicitly defined as in-scope Configuration, packaging, and distribution of client software required for the
Microsoft 365 service Management, configuration, and activation of mobile devices Applying security policies on mobile devices Implementing network configuration, analysis, bandwidth validation, testing, and monitoring Approval of technical change management process, and producing supporting documentation Rationalization and definition of group policies for the user, workstation, and server management Modification of a current operational model and operation guide Co-branding of Microsoft 365 user interfaces Decommissioning and removal of on-premises environments (such as messaging and collaboration) Construction and maintenance of the customer test environment, except as explicitly defined as in-scope Installing service packs and any required updates on infrastructure servers Important! Have you discussed the key project service deliverables with the customer? Service deliverable acceptance process. During the project, the partner will submit completed project service deliverables for the customer to review and approve. The customer’s use or partial use of a service deliverable constitutes acceptance of that service deliverable. The customer may provide acceptance or rejection of deliverables electronically through email. Within three business days of the date of submittal, the customer is required to: Accept the deliverable by signing, dating, and returning a service deliverable acceptance form, which can be sent by email, or by using (or partially using) the deliverable, or Reject the deliverable by notifying the partner in writing; the customer must include a complete list of reasons for rejection. Deliverables are deemed accepted unless the written rejection notification is received by the partner in the time frame specified. If a partner receives a rejection notice, he or she will correct the problems with a deliverable that are in scope for the project (and documented in this SOW), after which the deliverable is deemed accepted.
Problems that arise outside the scope of this SOW and feedback provided after a customer has approved a deliverable is addressed as a change request . Important! Have you discussed the Service deliverable acceptance process with the customer? Project governance. It is recommended that Project Governance is aligned to the Statement of Work. The governance structure and processes the team adheres to for the project are described in the following sections: Project Communication Use the following to communicate during the project: Communication plan: This document describes the frequency, audience, and content of communication with the team and stakeholders. The partner and the customer develop this project plan together. Status reports: The partner team prepares and issues regular status reports to inform stakeholders per the frequency as defined in the communication plan. Status meetings: The partner team schedules regular status meetings to review the overall project status, the acceptance of deliverables, and review open problems and risks. Risk and Issue Management Use the following procedure to manage active project issues and risks during the project: Identify: Identify and document project issues (current problems) and risks (potential problems) that could affect the project. Analyze and prioritize: Assess the potential impact and determine the highest priority risks and problems that will need to be actively managed. Plan and schedule: Determine the strategy for managing priority risks and issues and identify a resource that can take responsibility for mitigation and remediation. Track and report: Monitor and report the status of risks and problems. Escalate: Escalate the high-impact problems and risks (the team is unable to resolve) to project sponsors. Control: Review the effectiveness of risk and issue management actions Active issues and risks should be regularly monitored during the project. Change Management Process During the project, either the customer or partner can request modifications to
the Services described in the SOW. These changes only take effect when the proposed change is agreed upon by both parties. The change management process steps are: Document the change: The partner documents all change requests in a Partner Change Request Form and submits them to the customer. The Partner Change Request Form includes a description of the change and the estimated effect of implementing the change. Submit the Change Request. The customer receives the change request. The customer accepts or rejects the change. The customer has three business days to: Accept: The customer must sign and return the Change Request Form to the partner. Reject: If the customer does not want to proceed with the change or does not provide approval within three business days, no changes will be made. Escalation Path The partner project manager works closely with the customer project manager, project sponsor, and other designees to manage project issues, risks, and change requests as described previously. The customer provides reasonable access to the sponsor or sponsors to expedite resolution. The standard escalation path for review, approval, or dispute resolution is as follows: Project team member (Partner or the Customer) Project manager (Partner and the Customer) Partner FastTrack Manager Partner and the Customer project sponsor Project Completion Partner provides services defined in this SOW to the extent of the fees available and the term specified in the contract. If additional services are required, the partner uses the change management process and modifies the contract. The project is considered complete when at least one of the following conditions has been met: All fees available are used for services delivered and expenses incurred. The term of the project expires. All partner activities and in-scope items are completed. The contract is terminated. Date

				Generic Statement of Work (SOW) Template The Statement of Work (SOW) format herein is only meant to be a guide and is not necessarily all-inclusive; as such, contents should be tailored to the requirement. Consult your NOAA AGO Contracting Officer and the NOAA Acquisition Process Guide (APG) for further guidance. You will need to prepare a SOW, for instance, when acquiring a service but not relying on the Contractors commercial description to define the requirement. In this situation, purchasers are tailoring the commercial services performed by the Contractor (e.g., program management services) to meet a particular Government need (e.g., management of a process improvement program). SOW Format Background Objectives Scope Tasks Delivery Government-Furnished Property (GFP) Security Considerations Travel Special Material Requirements Other Unique Requirements and Considerations Place of performance Period of performance Background Identified as the Introduction, this section provides information needed to acquaint the reader with the basic acquisition situation. The background
information may: Identify the requirement in very general terms; Describe why the project is being pursued and how it relates to other projects; Summarize any statutory authority or regulations affecting the overall requirement; and Identify any background materials attached to the SOW. Objectives This section should provide a concise overview of: The contract effort goals and objectives; and How the results or end products will be used. Scope Provide a brief statement of what the Government expects to accomplish under the contract-the breadth and limitations of the contract effort. It should not include specific work tasks or a description of deliverable products. Tasks Sometimes identified as Requirements or Work Requirements, this section defines the tasks that the Contractor must complete during contract performance. The description of task requirements will depend on the approach that is selected to describe the required effort. For a Performance-Based Work Statement, this section should describe requirements in terms of results required rather than the methods for completing the work. This latitude will permit the Contractor to develop new and innovative ways to complete those tasks. For a Level of Effort Statement of Work, this section should identify all tasks that must be performed and the hours to be devoted to each task. For a Detailed Statement of Work, this section should describe how the service must be accomplished. It may include precise measurements, tolerances, materials, quality control requirements, and other Government requirements that control the processes of the Contractor. This section must describe requirements in a way that permits Contractor personnel to perform the service without direct Government supervision.
Contractor personnel must not be subject to the type of supervision and control usually prevailing between the Government and its employees. For example, a SOW may permit the Government to approve key personnel, but must not permit the Government to approve all personnel performing the service. The SOW should also not include words (e.g., use methods directed by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR)) that appear to indicate that the Government is managing day-to-day operations. Other items to consider: Specify requirements clearly so that all readers can understand them. Reference only the absolute minimum applicable specifications and standards needed. Tailor specifications and other documents. Separate general information from direction. Task Example 3.1 Task Areas Include specific titles of all tasks for required performance. Task 4.1 Title as applicable Task 4.2 Title as applicable Task 4.3 Title as applicable 3.2 Project Milestones/Completion Dates (Estimates and as applicable) Task Number Work Milestones Projected Completion Date 4.1 Describe in-process milestone as applicable (first for this task) Date Describe in-process milestone as applicable (second for this task) Date Describe in-process milestone as applicable (third for this task) Date 4.2 Describe in-process milestone as applicable Date 4.3 Describe in-process milestone as applicable Date 4.1 Task 1 - Title Describe the specific service to be provided for this task. Include milestones that are to be accomplished as applicable and as identified on the milestone schedule. Milestones can include such things as preliminary reports or data submittals, attendance at meetings, etc. 4.2 Task 2 - Title Describe the specific services to be provided. Include milestones that are to be accomplished as applicable and as identified on the milestone schedule. Milestones can include such things as preliminary reports or data submittals,
attendance at meetings, etc. 4.3 Task 3 - Title Describe the specific services to be provided. Include milestones that are to be accomplished as applicable and as identified on the milestone schedule. Milestones can include such things as preliminary reports or data submittals, attendance at meetings, etc. Delivery This section should clearly state: What the Contractor must deliver. If different tasks have different delivery requirements, they must be clearly identified. When the Contractor must deliver. This may be stated using actual dates, days after contract award, or using some other method that clearly marks the required delivery date. Where the Contractor must deliver the service. This may be stated as a location, an organization, a person identified by position (e.g., Contracting Officers Representative, a person identified by name or using some other description.) What documentation (if any) the Contractor must obtain from the Government to verify Government receipt of the delivery. Other items to consider: Include any associated review periods or incorporation of Government comments as applicable. Deliverables are different than task completion milestones. Milestones may not require a specific submittal. Include here the schedule for when final products such as data, reports or other items are required to be furnished to the primary requestor. Example Deliverable Schedule Deliverable Description Quantity/Media Date Completed 1 Identify the specific deliverable e.g. 5 printed copies and 3 copies on CD-ROM dd-mm-yyy Government review (as applicable) dd-mm-yyy Resubmit with Government comments e.g. 5 printed copies and 3 copies on CD-ROM dd-mm-yyy 2 Identify the specific deliverable As applicable dd-mm-yyy 3 Identify the specific deliverable As applicable dd-mm-yyy
Government-Furnished Property, Material, Equipment, or Information (GFP, GFM, GFE, or GFI) This section should identify any Government-furnished property provided to the Contractor. This includes all Government-furnished property, such as Government-furnished material, equipment, or information. If the list of property is extensive, this section should identify where that list can be found. Before offering to provide any property, make sure that it will be available when required, where required, and in the condition required by the contract. Failure to meet Government-furnished property requirements often lead to a Contractor claim for an equitable adjustment to contract price, delivery, or other requirements. See FAR 45 and NOAA APG for specific requirements about providing Government-furnished property. Security This section should identify any unique security requirements associated with contract performance (when applicable). These requirements may include, but are not limited to, such items as: Special pass or identification requirements; Special security clearance requirements; or Special escort requirements. Travel Describe any travel requirements that are to be encountered in the performance of the service(s). Special Material Requirements Describe requirements for any special materials that are to be encountered in the performance of the service(s). Other Unique Requirements Discuss any other unique requirements or considerations, e.g. - Unique Item Identification (UID) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Place of Performance This section should identify where the contract will be performed. If performance will occur at multiple Government locations, this section should
indicate which tasks must be completed where. If performance will be at the Contractors facility, the SOW need only state that requirement. Period of Performance The period of performance may be stated using actual dates, days after contract award, or using some other method. If different periods of performance will apply to different tasks, the tasks and related periods of performance should be clearly identified. SOW Language Tips: A variety of people with different perspectives and life experiences will read your SOW. Readers typically include Government and industry contracting personnel, managers, technical experts, accountants and lawyers. All these readers need to understand the SOW in a clear and concise manner; therefore, language selection is very important. Below are tips that you should consider when reviewing the SOW: Use simple words, phrases, and sentences whenever practical. Be concise, precise, and consistent. Keep sentences short and to the point. Normally the longer the sentence, the harder it is to understand. Use verbs in the active voice. A verb is in the active voice when it expresses an action performed by its subject. For example, The Contractor shall report contract progress quarterly. Conversely, avoid using verbs in the passive voice. A verb is in the passive voice when it expresses an action performed upon its subject or when the subject is the result of the action. For example, Contract progress shall be reported quarterly by the Contractor. Use shall or must when writing a requirement binding on the Contractor. Avoid should or may because they leave the decision on appropriate action up to the Contractor. Use will to indicate actions by the Government. Be consistent when using terminology. Use the same word to mean the same thing throughout your SOW. Avoid using different words to indicate the same type of action. Avoid redundancy. At best, requiring the Contractor to do the same thing in different parts of the SOW will add needless words to the SOW. At worst, there
may be subtle differences in the requirements that may lead to a dispute during contract performance. Avoid vague or inexact phrases and generalizations. Avoid catchall and open-ended phrases, such as, is common practice in the industry, as directed, or subject to approval. If you want to give the Contractor an opportunity to use their standard commercial practices, require each offeror to identify its commercial practices in a proposal and then include that proposal as part of the order/contract. Define technical terms. Avoid using Government jargon. Assure that it is clearly defined whenever jargon must be used. Only use any, either, and/or, etc. when allowing the Contractor to select an alternative. Use abbreviations or acronyms only after spelling them out the first time they are used (e.g., National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)). Spell them out even if they are commonly used by NOAA because a commercial Contractor may not be familiar with them. Identify the date or version of any document referenced in your SOW. Advise readers from industry where they can obtain referenced documents.

You are urged to refer to the VITA Contract for the definition of Services and for the allowable scope in drafting language for this section. You will notice subsections ”C” and “D” below offer areas for expanded detail on
training, support and maintenance services. You may add other subsections in which you wish to expand the information/details/requirements for other service areas as well. It is likely some of this detail will be a combination of your known needs and the Supplier’s proposal. In all cases the provisions should include all negotiated commitments by both parties, even if you reference by incorporation the Supplier’s proposal in any subsection.) C. Training Requirements and/or Authorized User Self-Sufficiency/Knowledge Transfer (Provide an overview and details of training services to be provided for your project and any special requirements for specific knowledge transfer to support successful implementation of the Solution. If the intent is for the Authorized User to become self-sufficient in operating or maintaining the Solution, determine the type of training necessary, and develop a training plan, for such user self-sufficiency. Describe how the Supplier will complete knowledge transfer in the event this Statement of Work is not completed due to actions of Supplier or the non-appropriation of funds for completion affecting the Authorized User. You may refer to the VITA Contract for guidance on the allowable scope for this. D. Support and Maintenance Requirements (Document the level of support, as available under the Contract, required by your project to operate and maintain the Solution.

Please read the VITA contract definitions for the definitions or Requirements and Acceptance. Ensure the language in this section does not conflict with the VITA Contract language.) Acceptance Criteria for this Solution will be based on a User Acceptance Test (UAT) designed by Supplier and accepted by the Authorized User. The UAT will ensure that all of the requirements and functionality required for the Solution have been successfully delivered. Supplier will provide the Authorized User with a detailed test plan and acceptance check list based on the mutually agreed upon UAT Plan. This UAT Plan check-list is incorporated into this SOW in Exhibit
B-X. Each deliverable created under this Statement of Work will be delivered to the Authorized User with a Deliverable Acceptance Receipt. This receipt will describe the deliverable and provide the Authorized User’s Project Manager with space to indicate if the deliverable is accepted, rejected, or conditionally accepted. Conditionally Accepted deliverables will contain a list of deficiencies that need to be corrected in order for the deliverable to be accepted by the Project Manager. The Project Manager will have ten (10) days from receipt of the deliverable to provide Supplier with the signed Acceptance VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D Statement of Work Template Page 5 of 10 Contract No. VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D Receipt unless an alternative schedule is mutually agreed to between Supplier and the Authorized User in advance. PROJECT ASSUMPTIONS AND PROJECT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES (This section contains areas to address project assumptions by both the Supplier and the Authorized User and to assign project-specific roles and responsibilities between the parties. Make sure that all assumptions are included to alleviate surprises during the project. Ensure that all primary and secondary (as needed) roles and responsibilities are included. You will tailor the Responsibility Matrix table below to fit your project’s needs.)

If delivery of any of these is critical to the schedule, you may want to identify such delivery with hard due dates tied to “business days after project start’ or “days after event/milestone.” Be sure to specify the delivery and point of contact information.)
PROVIDED BY THE COMMONWEALTH PROVIDED BY THE SUPPLIER SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (Provide (or reference as an Attachment) Authorized User’s security requirements.) For any individual Authorized User location, security procedures may include but not be limited to: background checks, records verification, photographing, and fingerprinting of Supplier’s employees or agents. Supplier may, at any time, be required to execute and complete, for each individual Supplier employee or agent, additional forms which may include non-disclosure agreements to be signed by Supplier’s employees or agents acknowledging that all Authorized User information with which such employees and agents come into contact while at the Authorized User site is confidential and proprietary. Any unauthorized release of proprietary information by the Supplier or an employee or agent of Supplier shall constitute a breach of the Contract. Supplier shall comply with all requirements in the Security Compliance section of the Contract REQUIRED STANDARDS, CERTIFICATIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS In addition to any standards and specifications included in the Contract, Supplier shall follow the standards and specifications listed below during performance of this effort. (List any specific Commonwealth, VITA, Federal, engineering, trade/industry or professional standards, certifications and specifications that Supplier is required to follow or possess in performing this work.

COV ITRM Policies and Standards: http://www.vita.virginia.gov/library/default.aspx?id=537 IEEE 802® HIPAA SAS 70 Type II RISK MANAGEMENT (Risk is a function of the probability of an event occurring and the impact of the negative effects if it does occur. Negative effects include schedule delay, increased costs, failure of dependent legacy system interoperability, other project dependencies that don’t align with this project’s schedule, and poor quality of deliverables. Depending on the level of risk of this project, as assessed by your Project Manager and/or Steering Committee, this section may contain any or all of the following components, at a level of detail commensurate with the level of risk. Remember to add them to the Deliverables table.) Initial Risk Assessment Authorized User and Supplier shall each provide an initial assessment from their point of view. VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D Statement of Work Template Page 7 of 10 Contract No. VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D B. Risk Management Strategy
(The list below is taken from VITA PMD template discussing what should go into a Risk Management Strategy. Don’t forget to consider and plan for any budget contingencies to accommodate potential risks that are identified.) Risk Identification Process: The processes for risk identification. Risk Evaluation and Prioritization: How risks are evaluated and prioritized. Risk Mitigation Options: Describe the risk mitigation options. They must be realistic and available to the project team. Risk Plan Maintenance: Describe how the risk plan is maintained during the project lifecycle. Risk Management Responsibilities: Identify all project team members with specific risk management responsibilities. (e.g., an individual responsible for updating the plan or an individual assigned as a manager). C. Risk Management Plan (Include a description of frequency and form of reviews, project team responsibilities, steering and oversight committee responsibilities and documentation. Be sure to add all deliverables associated with risk strategizing and planning to the list of Deliverables.) DISASTER RECOVERY Planning for disaster recovery for your project is paramount to ensure continuity of service. The criticalness and complexity of your project, including its workflow into other dependent systems of the Commonwealth or federal systems, will help you determine if you require a simple contingency plan or a full-blow contingency plan that follows the Commonwealth’s ITRM Guideline SEC508-00 found at this link: http://www.vita.virginia.gov/uploadedFiles/Library/ContingencyPlanningGuideline04_18_2007.pdf It is advisable that you visit the link before making your decision on how you need to address contingency planning and related deliverables in this SOW; as
well as, how this will impact your planned budget. A likely deliverable for this section would be a Continuity of Operations Plan. You may choose to include the above link in your final SOW to describe what the Plan will entail. The same link includes the following processes, which you may choose to list in your final requirements for this section, to be performed by your team, the Supplier or both and/or a steering committee if your project warrants such oversight and approval: Development of the IT components of the Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) Development and exercise of the IT Disaster Recovery Plan (IT DRP) within the COOP Development and exercise of the IT System Backup and Restoration Plan PERFORMANCE BOND (If your project is sizeable, complex and/or critical, and the VITA Contract does not already provide for a performance bond, you may want the Supplier to provide one. The VITA Contract may include an Errors and Omissions insurance requirement, which would cover the Supplier’s liability for any breach of the Contract or this SOW. Be sure to read the Contract for this information. However, if you feel that this project warrants further performance incentive due to the project or the Supplier’s viability, you may include the following language in this section.) The Supplier shall post performance bond in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the total contract value and provide a copy of the bond to Authorized user within (10) days of execution of this SOW Agreement. In the event that the Supplier or any subcontractor or any officer, director, employee or agent of the Supplier or any subcontractor or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Supplier or any subcontractor fails to fully and faithfully perform each material requirement of this SOW Agreement, including without limitation the Supplier’s obligation to indemnify the Authorized User, the performance bond shall be forfeited to Authorized User. The bond shall be in a
form VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D Statement of Work Template Page 8 of 10 Contract No. VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D customarily used in the technology industry and shall be written by a surety authorized to do business in Virginia and that is acceptable to Authorized User. OTHER TECHNICAL/FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (Provide any other unique project technical and functional requirements and expectations in sufficient detail in this section. Ensure they do not conflict with existing requirements in the VITA Contract. Several examples are listed.) Service Level Requirements Mean-Time-Between-Failure Requirements Data Access/Retrieval Requirements Additional Warranties REPORTING (The following are examples of reporting requirements which may be included in your SOW depending on the project’s need for governance. In an effort to help VITA monitor Supplier performance, it is strongly recommended that the SOW include “Supplier Performance Assessments”. These assessments may be performed at the Project Manager’s discretion and are not mandated by VITA.) Weekly/Bi-weekly Status Update. The weekly/bi-weekly status report, to be submitted by Supplier to the Authorized User, should include: accomplishments to date as compared to the
project plan; any changes in tasks, resources or schedule with new target dates, if necessary; all open issues or questions regarding the project; action plan for addressing open issues or questions and potential impacts on the project; risk management reporting. E. Supplier Performance Self-Assessment. Within thirty (30) days of execution of the project start, the Supplier and the Authorized User will agree on Supplier performance self-assessment criteria. Supplier shall prepare a monthly self-assessment to report on such criteria. Supplier shall submit its self-assessment to the Authorized User who will have five (5) days to respond to Supplier with any comments. If the Authorized User agrees with Supplier’s self -assessment, such Authorized User will sign the self-assessment and submit a copy to the VITA Supplier Relationship Manager. F. Performance Auditing (If you have included service level requirements in the above section entitled, Other Technical/Functional Requirements, you will want to include a requirement here for your ability to audit the results of the Supplier’s fulfillment of all requirements, Likewise, you may want to include your validation audit of the Supplier’s performance reporting under this Reporting section. It is important, however, that you read the VITA contract prior to developing this section’s content so that conflicts are avoided. Suggested language is provided below, but must be customized for your project.) Authorized User (or name of IV&V contractor, if there is one), will audit the results of Supplier’s service level obligations and performance requirements on a monthly/quarterly basis, within ten (10) days of receipt of Supplier’s self-assessments and service report(s). Any discrepancies will be discussed between the Authorized User and Supplier and any necessary invoice/payment adjustments will be made. If agreement cannot be reached, the Authorized User and Supplier will escalate the matter in accordance with the Escalation provision of the Contract. (If none, you may add your escalation procedure in this section.)
Supplier Performance Assessments (You may want to develop assessments of the Supplier’s performance and disseminate such assessments to other Authorized Users of the VITA Contract. Prior to dissemination of such assessments, Supplier will have an opportunity to respond to the assessments, and independent verification of the assessment may be utilized in the case of disagreement.) VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D Statement of Work Template Page 9 of 10 Contract No. VA-190906-STVN, Exhibit D CHANGE MANAGEMENT (Changes to the baseline SOW must be documented for proper project oversight. Depending on your project, you may need to manage and capture changes to configuration, incidents, deliverables, schedule, price or other factors your team designates as critical. Any price changes must be done in compliance with the Code of Virginia, § 2.2-4309. Modification of the contract, found at this link: http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+coh+2.2-4309+500825. Changes to the scope of this SOW must stay within the boundaries of the scope of the VITA Contract. For complex and/or major projects, it is recommended that you use the VITA PMD processes and templates located at: http://www.vita.virginia.gov/oversight/projects/default.aspx?id=567. Administrative or non-technical/functional changes (deliverables, schedule, point of contact, reporting, etc.) should extrapolate the affected sections of this SOW in a “from/to” format and be placed in a numbered modification letter referencing this SOW and date, with a new effective date. The VITA Contract may include a template for your use or you may obtain one from the VITA Contract’s Point of Contact. It is very important that changes do not conflict with, but do comply with, the VITA Contract, which takes precedence. The
following language may be included in this section, but additional language is needed to list any technical/functional change management areas specific to this SOW; i.e., configuration, incident, work flow, or any others of a technical/functional nature.) All changes to this SOW must comply with the Contract. Price changes must comply with the Code of Virginia, § 2.2-4309.

It may include precise measurements, tolerances, materials, quality control requirements, and other government requirements that control the processes of the contractor. Describe the requirements in a way that permits the contractor personnel to perform the service without direct government supervision. Contractor personnel must not be subject to the supervision and control usually prevailing between the government and its employees. For example, a SOW may permit the government to approve key personnel, but must not permit the government to approve all personnel performing the service. The SOW should also not include words (e.g., use methods directed by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR)") that appear to indicate the government is managing day-to-day operations. Other items to consider: Specify requirements clearly so all readers can understand the content. Reference only the absolute minimum applicable specifications and standards needed. Tailor specifications and other documents.
Separate general information from direction. 4.0 Government Furnished: {List any government-furnished support, data, property or facilities. Describe government responsibility for reviewing and approving reports and final products generated under the contract.
